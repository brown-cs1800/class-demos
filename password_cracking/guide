What is hashcat? 

Hashcat is the self-proclaimed free fastest password recovery tool.

How to setup hashcat?

You can use legacy-hashcat (https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat-legacy) which doesn’t have GPU. You can clone the git repo and follow along or try this demo on your own. More detailed instructions can be found: https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs166/demos/ 

Benchmark hashes with hashcat:

./hashcat-cli64.bin -b

Cracking unsalted MD5: 

Step 1: Create a word list

Wordlist: (TA passwords, most common of 2017, student examples, etc)
roberto12345
letmein
juliaqwerty
$hakennot$t1rr3d
secret@gentman
ilovedrones
12345678
password
password1234
hello
starwars

Step 2: Create the hashes of your wordlist file. For this example I used md5sum:

for i in $(cat wordlist); do echo -n "$i"| md5sum | tr -d " *-" >> hashes; done


Step 3: Get a dictionary file: I used rockyou.txt (https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords) which lists most common passwords from the RockYou hack a couple years back (https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/14/rockyou-hack-security-myspace-facebook-passwords/). 

Step 4: Run hashcat dictionary attack:

./hashcat-cli64.bin -m 0 -a 0 hashes rockyou.txt

***
Notes:

What is hashcat doing? 

-m [NUM]: hash type
0 = MD5

hashes: The MD5 hashfile we made

rockyou.txt: The rockyou dictionary file

***

Cracking MD5Crypt with Salt:

Step 1: Use the word list from part 1, create a new hash file this time by adding a salt to your password. For our example the salt will be the same for all passwords. This is BAD. Do not do this:

for i in $(cat wordlist); do openssl passwd -1 -salt "supersecretsalt" "$i" | tr -d " -" >> hashes; done

What does this do: 
-1:  md5-based password algorithm
-salt [SALT]: salts the password

Step 2: Run hashcat

This time we will be using md5crypt, MD5 (Unix), Cisco-IOS $1$ (MD5) so the flag will be: -m 500. You can find the different encryption flags here: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes

./hashcat-cli64.bin -m 500 salthashes rockyou.txt

Cracking with Mask:

Step 1:

Make a wordlist of passwords to test that are the same length:

maskdemo.txt:
cooll
beans
cs166
apple
super
agent
james
bondd
Alice
Okayy
cs162
hacky
meow1

Step 2: Hash with MD5

for i in $(cat maskdemo.txt); do echo -n "$i"| md5sum | tr -d " *-" >> hashes; done

Step 3: Run hashcat

* Attack modes:
    0 = Straight
    1 = Combination
    2 = Toggle-Case
    3 = Brute-force
    4 = Permutation
    5 = Table-Lookup
    8 = Prince

Our demo example:  ./hashcat-cli64.bin -a 3 hashes ?l?l?l?l?l
Built in example: ./hashcat-cli64.bin -a 3 examples/A3.M0.hash ?l?l?l?l?l

Cracking with Rule Based Attacks

Step1: Create a rules file

If you have a list of passwords:
password
mysecret
qwerty

What kind of rules are there?

Add 123 to end:
password123
mysecret123
qwerty123

Capitalize first word:
Password
Mysecret
Qwerty

So you can create a rule file with these two rules:
$c
$1 $2 $3

There’s plenty of rule files you can use online. We’re going to be using this one:

:
#Lowercase
l
#Uppercase
u
#Capitalise first character
c
#Add '1' to the end
$1
#Add '2' to the end
$2
#Add '3' to the end
$3
#Add '4' to the end
$4
#Add '5' to the end
$5
#Add '6' to the end
$6
#Add '7' to the end
$7
#Add '8' to the end
$8
#Add '9' to the end
$9
#Add '123' to the end
$1 $2 $3
#Substitute 'a' for '@'
sa@
#Substitute 'a' for '4'
sa4
#Substitute 'e' for '3'
se3
#substitute 'l' for '1'
sl1
#Substitute 'a' for '@', 'e' for '3', 'l' for '1'
sa@ se3 sl1
#Substitute 'a' for '4', 'e' for '3', 'l' for '1'
sa4 se3 sl1

Step 3: Run hashcat

./hashcat-cli64.bin -m 0 hashes rockyou.txt -r rule1 --debug-mode=1 --debug-file=matched.rule

Cracking a larger set of passwords? 

In 2012 eHarmony was hacked and the hashed passwords were publicly published. As a CS166 student you can now hack like the pros and recover some eHarmony passwords using hashcat.

Unlike the previous examples, this takes a while to recover all the passwords:

http://www.adeptus-mechanicus.com/codex/hcateasy/hcateasy.php 

Weird things about this set:
For some reason eHarmony decided to store all the passwords uppercase. So this eliminates a lot of variety 
eHarmony uses MD5: so try -m 0

Recover passwords of length 6:
./hashcat-cli64.bin -m 0 -a 3 -1 ?u?d --remove eHarmony.hash ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1

./hashcat-cli64.bin -m 0 eHarmony.hash rockyou.txt 

7. Hashcat with another char set (Russian, Italian, etc)
