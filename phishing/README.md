[James Veitch: This is what happens when you reply to spam email](https://www.ted.com/talks/james_veitch_this_is_what_happens_when_you_reply_to_spam_email?language=en)

 - 10 minute Ted Talk
 - Very funny, but highlights the importance of awareness and caution
 - Key takeaway: Online adversaries do ridiculous things that we would probably never fall for, but they continue doing these things because it works. While we probably wouldn't fall for emails as blatantly obvious as the ones in the video, phishers are becoming increasingly effective at feigning realistic identities and credentials. We are more susceptible to phishing attacks than we may think.

## Phishing Challenge
[Vinci Works Phishing Challenge](https://vinciworks.com/landing_pages/phishing_demo)

 - Provides a really good GUI with several "apps" to train the user, including:
	 - Phishing emails
	 - Social engineering
	 - File sharing
	 - Safe surfing
- This would be great for students to do in their own time, as it walks you through everything step-by-step and isn't complicated. 
- You can "test your knowledge" on each topic and see how vulnerable of a user you are

## Wifi Sniffing and Phishing
[Phishing Attacks Repo](https://github.com/defeo/phishing-demo)

 - Didn't get this working, but this is a more technical and complex demo. It deals with internet traffic and insecure servers. 

## Emails -- en masse

 - You can be anyone you want to be. [Guerilla Mail](https://www.guerrillamail.com/inbox) allows you to create temporary email addresses with whatever name you want, using one of their many domains. Tools like this make it easy for phishers to take on a new identity each time one of them is exposed.
 - What if we try phishing the class and have the link be hidden and redirected a bunch of layers until we finally get to a subpage of the course website that tells them that they're the 97th person to have been phished by that email? That'd be fun and interesting!

## Phish Bowl

 - PSA, Brown has a lovely phish bowl to sniff out suspicious emails for us.
 - You can look for reported scams or report them yourself.
