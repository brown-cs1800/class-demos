# Traceroot:


Visualizes an IP packet path on a world map for different hops. You can enter an IP or domain name and see the intermediary nodes and delays.


Good examples: 


www.brown.edu

gazeta.ru

baidu.com


https://visualtraceroute.net/ (or github source: https://github.com/leolewis/openvisualtraceroute)


Only issue- This is a jar file that has to be setup to work properly. :(


# BGP:


This visualizes an example of a BGP hijack from 2008 when Pakistan Telecom hijacked YouTube traffic when an upstream provider broadcasted the incorrect IP address. This demo also demonstrates YouTube advertising a new, more specific IP and resolving the issue.

# DNS:


These are a little more technically heavy, but visualize Chinese internet congestion and censorship using DNS.

The first example compares internet congestion when making a DNS query to an IP inside vs. outside the Great Firewall

The second example shows how China censors DNS for the record of the nytimes.com. For this example there is an interactive link (https://odwvxme.share.thousandeyes.com/) along with visualizations
